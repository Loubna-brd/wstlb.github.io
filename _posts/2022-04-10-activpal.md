I did not hesitate much to chose what I would write on for this first blog article. The activPAL has been my companion since I started doing research as a PhD student. It is not perfect, but I have used it in every single one of my human subject studies so far. Here is why.

# What is the activPAL?

[The activPAL](https://www.palt.com) is a thigh-worn accelerometer in the form of a thin (23.5 x 43 x 5 mm), lightweight chip (9g).

It integrates a proprietary algorithm that classifies activities as lying, sitting, standing, stepping, cycling, and driving. This technology belongs to the company [Pal Technologies](https://www.palt.com/about-us/) created in 2001, in Glasgow, Scotland. Its latest version, the activPAL4, was released in 2018. The activPAL comes with a full suite of softwares to configure, download, process, and visualize the data.

# Technical specifications and attachment

|                    | activPAL            |
| ------------------ |:-------------------:|
| Measurement        | 3-axes acceleration |
| Range              | +/- 4g              |
| Sampling frequency | 20 or 40Hz          |
| Memory size        | 64MB                |
| Battery life       | 14 days+            |
| Charge time        | 3 hours             |

The sensor comes with a docking station to charge, setup, and download the data from multiple or one sensor. The docking station can be plugged on the computer via USB.

The activPAL requires a placement on the thigh. It is first placed within a protective nitrile sleeve to make it waterproof and is attached on the thigh using medical tape.

# Why and how do I use it?

In my research, I study human movement using persistent monitoring: the monitoring of human dynamics over long periods to capture the variability of human beahvior. For this purpose, I needed a sensor with high battery life, non invasive, and with an easy attachment to favor wear time. The activPAL met all these criteria while also offering an accurate classification algorithm, making my life easier. Ideally, the sensor would have been a full inertial measurement unit with a gyroscope and a magnetometer in addition to the accelerometer. 

I use it to monitor human walking in the real world, and understand the variability in walking kinematics. An example for a study where I used it can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/walking-in-the-wild810/home). 

# Software and outputs

The activPAL comes with an extensive software suites for sensor setup, data download, and data visualization. Each software is downloaded separately and exists for both Windows and OSX.
## PALconnect
PALconnect is the software used to set up and download the data from the sensor. When you plug your sensor to your computer using the docking station, it will be automatically detected by the software. Then you can see the charge status, download the data (if any), and set up a new data collection. The parameters you can chose for a new data collection are:
- sampling rate
- start time: you can differ the start time of the data collection
- duration: within the limits of the battery life, which varies depending on the sampling rate you chose
- name: you can add a name to your data collection, although the file name will have the start time and the number of days or hours of data collected

### Data Visualization
This software can be used to visualize and download your data. The data visualization options are pretty nice and gives you a good amount of information. Below, you can see a visualization of the entirety of the data in this circular form representing the different days. At a glance, you can get an understanding of the sleep and activity patterns and levels of the subject.

If the circle is a little too exotic for you, you can also visualize your data linearly, by days or hours.

### Data Download
There are plenty of files you can download from the data. You can find a list and details [here](https://kb.palt.com/categories/exports/). The ones I personally use are the uncompressed acceleration data file and the events file. I combine them to extract the acceleration data when someone is stepping. 

## PALbatch
PALbatch allows you to process multiple data files at a time. You provide an input folder, where your files are, and an output folder where the software will generate the different output files you chose. It can be handy when you collect data from multiple subjects at a time.
