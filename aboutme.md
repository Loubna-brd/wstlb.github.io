Originally from France, I live currently in the US where I am completing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the [University of Michigan](https://brg.engin.umich.edu). My focus is on the use of wearable sensing technologies to understand human movement. I specialize in developing solutions for the monitoring of individuals in the real world for extended periods. 
Outside of research, I am also a private pilot, and I hope to include some aspects of this passion in this website.
